# Best MBA Project Ever

A polished React single-page app that showcases the BestMbaProjectEver talent marketplace concept. The project is built with Vite + Tailwind CSS and mirrors a mobile-first product mockup while remaining production ready.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 to explore the mockup.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

The generated production bundle lives in `dist/`.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

The build is configured to publish to the `/mba-project/` subdirectory that GitHub Pages uses for the project site. Deploy by running:

```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

The deploy script pushes the compiled `dist/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch using `gh-pages`.
